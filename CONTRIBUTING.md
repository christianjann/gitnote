# Contributing

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

Contributions are welcome, do not hesitate to open an issue, a pull request, etc...
For features, it's better to create an issue first, in order to get feedback on whether the feature is wanted or not, and to align on the best approach before starting development.
